This repo includes my solution to a section of a Udemy course called "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Yu.

This challenge is about Plotly t-Tests & Distributions

specifically;

+ How to superimpose histograms to show differences in distributions

+ How to use a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to show a graphic estimate of a distribution.

+ How to use scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values.

+ How to highlight different parts of a time series chart in Matplotib.

+ How to add and configure a Legend in Matplotlib.

+ Use NumPy's .where() function to process elements depending on a condition.
